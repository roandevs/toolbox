## Information

- This is just another project I worked on during 2020 when I was learning about NextJS. Since then I have learn't a lot more and would do a lot of things differently in terms of how this project is structured and built.

## Features

- Utilizes built in Node.JS modules to encrypt & decrypt data

- Uses websockets to publish real-time updates

- Reminder system constantly checks for due reminders and uses nodemailer to automatically email a notification it to my local mail-server regarding any reminders
